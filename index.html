title: 3D User Interfaces
---

<p></p>This class will cover the design and implementation of 3D user interfaces on a variety of devices, from desktops and laptops to phones and tablets to head-worn AR and VR displays. The primary focus will be immersive 3D interfaces and interactions. Topics will include the history of 3D UIs and VR, 3D applications, design and implementation of interaction techniques, with some discussion of human factors, design, security, privacy, ethics.</p>
 
<p>For the fall 2020 offering, students will do assignments and projects using traditional 2D devices (computers, phones and/or tablets) and modern VR head-worn displays. We will use 3D social spaces (desktop and VR) to interact, present posters, and experience 3D immersive UIs. Programming and development will be done with web-based technology (Javascript/Typescript, WebGL, WebXR, and tools like three.js and babylon.js).  </p>
