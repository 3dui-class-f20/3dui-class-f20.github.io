# Schedule

The schedule will very likely change, but it represents the current best estimate of what topics will be covered and when.  We will have regular QUIZZES on Canvas, based on the book chapters and other material from the class.

We will update it here and post announcements on canvas when things change.

Required readings are in the Reading column. Links to Videos are in the Videos column.  I expect you will have watch the videos before the corresponding class period.

Any reading in parenthesis are recommended, and you should at least skim them to be familiar with them at a high level (in case you need that material to understand future chapters, or for an assignment).

The Meeting Locations details will be posted on Canvas.  We will either meet in Bluejeans (early on), Teams video (after first week ), Hubs (links on Canvas), or some other social VR platform we are exploring (e.g., Altspace, RecRoom, BigScreen).
