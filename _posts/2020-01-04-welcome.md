Welcome to the Fall 2020 offering of 3D User Interfaces at Georgia Tech.  We'll be using Canvas (primarily for grades), Teams chat and discussion (I will add people to Teams throughout the first week), Github for course materials (this site, the assignments and samples).

We will also leverage the VR displays and various social VR platforms to _experience_ 3D user interfaces, as we both do assignments with and above the technology.  

Details of the [resources we will use this semester](/resources) are a starting point for how I am thinking about this semester, but will very likely evolve as the semester progresses.
